# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences department at the University of Maryland, College Park, in Dr. Jacob Wenegrat’s group. My work is focused on air-sea interaction at submesoscale using observations and coupled model simulations, more precisely on current and thermal feedbacks. I am currently part of NASA’s S-MODE project. 

For my personal interests, I enjoy learning new languages, playing video games, and illustrating. 

My future goals towards Physical Oceanography and Academia are focused on pedagogically improving Geophysical Fluid Dynamics learning.
